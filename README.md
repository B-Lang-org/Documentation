This is a repository for open source BSV.

BSV (the name has murky roots in "Bluespec SystemVerilog") is a High-Level Hardware Design Language developed at Bluespec, Inc. (www.bluespec.com) and previously at Sandburst Corp., with roots in research at MIT in the 1990s.  BSV draws its primary inspirations from:
- Term Rewriting Systems (to express complex concurrent behavior), and
- Haskell (to express complex, strongly-typed structure).
The BSV language specification (included here) is open.

This site includes the BSV Reference Guide, which is the principal language definition and specification, and other open source BSV material including tutorials and example designs, ranging from very simple to complex.
