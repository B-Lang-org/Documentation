This is a repository for open source BSV.

BSV (the name has murky roots in "Bluespec SystemVerilog") is a
High-Level Hardware Design Language developed at Bluespec,
Inc. (www.bluespec.com) and previously at Sandburst Corp., with roots
in research at MIT in the 1990s.  BSV draws its primary inspirations
from:
- Term Rewriting Systems (to express complex concurrent behavior), and
- Haskell (to express complex, strongly-typed structure).

The BSV language specification (included here) is open, i.e., people
are free to create their own implementations (simulators, synthesis
tools, etc.).

On Feb 26, 2010, at a "SystemVerilog Requirements
Gathering Meeting" conducted by the IEEE P1800 SystemVerilog Standards
Committee in San Jose, Bluespec, Inc. offered to donate the entire BSV
Language for incorporation into the next revision of the SystemVerilog
standard, but the offer did not meet the priority threshold of the
members present. [See Bluespec's offer at: Historical/Bluespec_Offer_to_Donate_BSV_to_IEEE_P1800_SystemVerilog.pdf]

This site includes the BSV Reference Guide, which is the principal
language definition and specification, and other open source BSV
material including tutorials and example designs, ranging from very
simple to complex.
